# Badge Hardware
The badge uses a 9.7 inch Pervasive Displays E2969JS0B1 electronic paper panel that was recycled from price tags which were destined for a now bankrupt German department store chain, coupled with an ESP32-S3 microcontroller.

## Pins

The board only has two truly free GPIOs

* GPIO9
* GPIO41

The SAO ports, however, have many possibilities

* SAO1: GPIO2 and GPIO42
* SAO2: GPIO4 and GPIO5
* SAO3: GPIO7 and GPIO6
* I2C bus: SDA on GPIO17 and SCL on GPIO18

The row of WS2812-compatible LEDs is on GPIO38

## Buttons

* Menu +/-: GPIO40 / GPIO15
* User A/B: GPIO39 / GPIO16

# Applications
In its out of the box configuration the badge can show the 2026 Supercon schedule, act as a digital name tag, and cycle through a built-in collection of art from Hackaday's incredible Art Director Joe Kim. If you come up with additional apps that you'd like to share, feel free to make a pull request.

Press Menu +/- to open the app menu, Menu +/- to pick an app, and User A or B to launch it. The LED bar shows the selected app: each page of 8 apps has its own colour (orange, cyan, magenta, red, green, blue).

Press Menu + and Menu - together, from the menu or inside any app, to open the menu and draw the app grid: a table with the columns "LED Color" and "LED 1" to "LED 8", and one row per LED page, starting with the page colour (ORANGE, CYAN, MAGENTA, ...). Unused slots say "Empty", and two empty rows follow the last app. All app names share one font size, the largest at which every name fits. A short help text at the bottom explains the buttons. If the badge has owner profile support (`lib/owner.py`), the help text also explains how to personalize the badge by editing `/data/owner.json` over USB, no desktop tool needed. The selection is still shown on the LED bar only, so the grid is drawn once and doesn't refresh while you move.

To sign your badge's app screen, drop a 1-bit binary PBM (`P4`, at most 320x80) at `/data/signature.pbm`. It is drawn in the lower right corner.

Press all four buttons together to make the selected app (or, inside an app, the running app) the boot app. The LEDs flash green. Do it again on the same app to unpin it (red flash). The pinned app is drawn in red and marked BOOT on the grid.

At boot the badge starts, in order of preference: the app grid if Menu + or Menu - is held down; the pinned boot app; the last app launched from the menu (remembered in `/data/last_app.json`); otherwise the app grid. Both settings live in `/data/boot.json`, e.g. `{"resume": true, "pinned": {"module": "nametag", "app": "Nametag"}}`. `{"resume": false}` turns off resuming the last app.

Buttons count as pressed together when they go down within 150 ms of each other, so single presses act on release or after 150 ms. Inside an app, User A/B pressed before the Menu buttons still reach the app.

# Displaying Images

The badge's display only supports three colors: white, black, red. Shading between those needs to be implemented by dithering pixels of those colors together. Unlike LCD, CRT, or other displays you may be used to, you cannot set multiple colors within a single pixel, each pixel is only one of the three colors.

The badge firmware picks a color for each pixel based on this logic:
- If the red value is >50% and blue and green are both <50%, then the pixel will be red.
- If the red, green, and blue values of the pixel are all <50%, then the pixel will be black.
- Otherwise the pixel will be white.

Additionally, since the display is so large, loading large images can easily run out of memory. Therefore, it is best to compress each image down to a limited color space before placing on the badge. This is easily done with [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/), namely with the command `magick oldfile.png -remap scripts/palette.gif newfile.png`. This reduces the image down to a colorspace that only supports 3 colors, which are white, black, and red.

Based on the above pixel logic, where each pixel is already one of the three supported colors, it's easy to see how the image will be displayed. Luckily, but converting the image on your computer, you can see what it will look like before rendering it on the badge.
