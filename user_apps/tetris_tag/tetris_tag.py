"""Tetris Tag. Tetris-like pieces fall and stack up to spell a name along the
bottom edge of the screen, the name blinks, stays up for HOLD_S seconds, then it is
built again (or the next name, if NAMES lists more than one).

User A: turn the left falling piece 90 degrees clockwise
User B: turn the right falling piece 90 degrees clockwise
(between names, User A skips to the next name and User B restarts the current one)

A red banner with white Helvetica Bold lettering runs across the top of the screen.
The lettering is an image made on a computer by make_banner.py. Edit NAMES and the
settings below to make it your own.

The panel's own refresh takes about 30 s, far too slow to animate. On B1 panels with
lib/epd_partial.py (about 0.65 s a frame) two pieces fall at a time, like a two-player
Tetris, in partial refreshes: the screen is cleared with one full refresh that also draws
the red banner, then only the pixels that change are redrawn. Both pieces appear
at 25% of the screen height turned a random quarter turn and fall without turning.
User A turns the left piece and User B the right one, 90 degrees clockwise per press.
Once a piece is the right way up it drops into place on the next refresh. A piece
nobody has turned starts turning itself when it reaches 50% of the screen height.
Elsewhere the app falls back to a slideshow, one full refresh per snapshot, showing
the pieces landed (black) and the next few still in the air (red).
